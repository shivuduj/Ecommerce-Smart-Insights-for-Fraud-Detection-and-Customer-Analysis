#Ecommerce Smart Insights for Fraud Detection and Customer Retention Analytics

##Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data to detect fraudulent activities and improve customer retention strategies. We use Snowflake SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization.

##Dataset Overview
We have four key datasets:
Customers – Customer details and purchase history
Transactions – Order details with timestamps and status
Web Logs – User browsing activity
Fraud Rules – Rules used to identify fraudulent transactions

##Project Workflow
1️. Data Loading & Processing
Load CSV files into Snowflake tables
Handle missing values & data transformation
Perform data quality checks
2️. Fraud Detection
Identify suspicious transactions based on predefined fraud rules
Analyze fraudulent transactions by amount, location, and frequency
3️. Customer Retention Analysis
Segment customers based on purchase history
Identify high-value customers and churn risks
Evaluate repeat purchases & engagement trends
4️. Power BI Visualization
The following reports were created to analyze transaction patterns and customer spending behavior:

1️. Line Chart – Displays the sum of total revenue by year to observe revenue trends.
2️. Card Visual – Shows the sum of total transactions to highlight overall transaction volume.
3️. Clustered Bar Chart – Represents the sum of total spent by customer ID, ranking top spenders.
4️. Pie Chart – Illustrates the sum of total transactions by customer ID, providing a proportional breakdown.
These insights help in understanding spending patterns, detecting fraud, and improving retention strategies.

##Technology Stack
  SQL – Snowflake (Data Processing & Analysis)
  Power BI – Data Visualization & Dashboarding
  Cloud Storage – Snowflake Staging for data ingestion

 ##Key Insights from the Analysis
 Fraudulent transactions tend to have high values and originate from specific locations.
 Loyal customers make frequent purchases, while at-risk customers show declining engagement.
 Payment method trends reveal insights into customer behavior and fraud risks.
